# Bluemix Hands-on Lab for IoT: Creating a Taxi-Simulator

In this Lab you will create a **Taxi-Simulator** for IoT.
This Taxi-Simulator will create **sample data** for a Data Analytics part, in one of the following Labs of a Hands-on Workshop.

In the following image you can see the dependency of the two Labs.

![01_Lab_overview](images/01_Lab_overview.jpg)

The objective of the first Lab is related to IoT, that means you will get a basic understanding of the IBM IoT and how to
customize your own flow in Node-RED, by using the given IoT Data to display in your Node-RED Dashboard UI.

**Here are the base UseCases of the UI**

![01_basic_usecases](images/01_basic_usecases.jpg)

**Functionality of the existing Node-RED flow**

1. With the taxi-simulator you can create different Taxi devices inside the Watson IoT Platform.
2. You can choose the number of taxis you want to create.
3. A created taxi will simulate speed and geolocation and the created data will be stored in a database.
4. The flow contains a dashboard UI which provides the following functionality:

    - Create sample IoT devices
    - Observe the speeding of the Taxis
    - Start and stop simulation
    - Observe the first simulated taxi and if the speeding is too high get a notification. (This will be your task to implement.)

**The Lab contains the following steps**

*a) Setup:*
* A simulator for Taxis, sending their speed and location information.
* Setup the IBM Watson IoT

*b) Create your own Node-RED flow*
* Use Watson IoT as input in your flow
* Use the Node-RED for implementing some logic and UI

**What you will use in IBM Bluemix?**

* The **Node-RED Starter** _Boiler Template_ which contains a **Cloudant DB** and a **Node.JS Server**.
* You will add additional nodes into the Node-RED instance ([Node-RED Dashboard Node](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard), [Node-RED Virtual IoT Device Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-iot-virtual-device), [Node-RED Objectstore](http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-objectstore) and [Node-RED MessageHub](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-messagehub))
* The [Watson IoT Service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/internet-of-things-platform?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south)
* The [Object Store Database](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/Object-Storage?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south)
* The [Message Hub](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?context=services&app=bdd3e76c-09b7-47a6-8515-50c7e6b477e9&env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aeu-gb&search=Message%20Hub)
